# Next Steps for Quizness Partner

## Bug Fixes Implemented

1. **CORS Configuration Fix**

   - Updated the CORS middleware in the backend to properly handle preflight requests
   - Added explicit methods and increased cache time to reduce preflight requests

2. **AI Error Handling Improvements**

   - Added robust JSON parsing error handling in the OpenAI response processing
   - Created fallback questions to ensure the app works even when AI requests fail
   - Added handling for markdown-formatted JSON responses

3. **Test Infrastructure Setup**
   - Implemented backend unit tests with pytest
   - Set up frontend component tests with Vitest and React Testing Library
   - Added configuration for proper mocking of external dependencies

## Current Status

The application is now more robust with better error handling and test coverage. Our fixes have addressed:

- Backend CORS issues that were causing 400 errors for preflight requests
- JSON parsing errors in OpenAI responses
- Basic test infrastructure for both backend and frontend

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Increase Test Coverage

- **Backend:**

  - Add more comprehensive API tests with database interaction
  - Create integration tests that test the entire flow from request to database
  - Add more test cases for error conditions

- **Frontend:**
  - Add tests for all major components (currently only Button is tested)
  - Add tests for API hooks using mock service worker
  - Create end-to-end tests with Cypress for complete user flows

### 2. Feature Improvements

- **Backend:**

  - Implement better caching for OpenAI responses to reduce API costs
  - Add support for additional document types (Word, HTML, etc.)
  - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

- **Frontend:**
  - Add better error handling with user-friendly error messages
  - Implement loading states for better UX
  - Add animations for smoother transitions

### 3. Security & Performance

- **Security:**

  - Add proper authentication and authorization
  - Sanitize user inputs (particularly in text submission)
  - Implement CSRF protection

- **Performance:**
  - Optimize database queries with proper indexing
  - Add server-side caching for quiz results
  - Optimize frontend bundle size

### 4. DevOps & Monitoring

- **CI/CD:**

  - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
  - Implement automated deployments
  - Add code quality checks (linting, formatting)

- **Monitoring:**
  - Add logging with structured log format
  - Implement error tracking (Sentry or similar)
  - Set up monitoring for API availability and performance

## Conclusion

The application has a solid foundation but needs additional work on test coverage and error handling. By focusing on the above next steps, we can create a more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly application.
