# Development Plan & Milestones

This document tracks all major development steps, milestones, and their sub-tasks for the Quizness Partner project. Check off items as you complete them!

---

## 1. Project Initialization

- [x] Set up project folder structure
- [x] Create README and .gitignore

- [x] Set up database migrations (Alembic)
- [x] Implement API endpoints:
  - [x] `POST /upload-document` (accepts text or file)
  - [x] `POST /generate-quiz` (calls GPT, returns quiz)
  - [x] `POST /submit-answer` (records answers)
  - [x] `GET /quiz/:id` (fetches quiz data)
- [x] Integrate OpenAI API for quiz generation
- [x] Add PDF parsing (PyMuPDF)
- [x] Add unit tests (pytest, mock GPT calls)

## 3. Frontend Core

- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS
- [x] Set up React Query for API calls
- [x] Create main pages:
  - [x] Home / Upload page
  - [x] Quiz page (interactive UI)
  - [x] Results page
- [x] Create reusable components:
  - [x] File/Text upload
  - [x] Quiz question display
  - [x] Answer selection & feedback
- [x] Connect frontend to backend APIs
- [x] Add frontend tests (Vitest/Jest)

## 4. Database & Persistence

- [x] Set up PostgreSQL with Docker
- [x] Implement ORM models (SQLAlchemy)
- [x] Store quizzes and results
- [x] Add user model (for future auth)

## 5. Infrastructure & DevOps

- [ ] Add GitHub Actions for CI (run tests on push)
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks (Black, flake8, isort)
- [x] Add environment variable documentation
- [x] Add production Docker optimizations

## 6. Bug Fixes & Test Coverage (Current Phase)

- [x] Fix CORS issues in the backend
- [x] Improve error handling in AI quiz generation
- [x] Fix API endpoint issues
- [x] Set up basic test infrastructure
- [ ] Increase test coverage to at least 70%
- [ ] Fix remaining UI/UX issues
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete flows

## 7. Documentation & Polish

- [ ] Update README with usage instructions
- [ ] Add API documentation (FastAPI docs)
- [ ] Add code comments and docstrings
- [ ] Add screenshots/gifs to README

## 8. Future Features (Post-MVP)

- [ ] User authentication & saved progress
- [ ] Support for more file types (Word, HTML, etc.)
- [ ] Difficulty selection
- [ ] Quiz formats beyond multiple-choice
- [ ] Audio/text-to-speech support
- [ ] Leaderboards/gamification

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Test all database models and CRUD operations
   - Test utility functions separately (ai_utils.py, db_utils.py)
   - Mock external API calls (OpenAI)

2. **API Tests**
   - Test all API endpoints with proper payloads
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Verify CORS functionality

### Frontend Testing

1. **Component Tests**

   - Test UI components in isolation
   - Verify component props and state changes
   - Test form validation and submission

2. **Integration Tests**

   - Test API interactions with mock server
   - Verify routing and navigation
   - Test quiz flow from creation to results

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Complete user flows (create quiz, take quiz, view results)
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile responsiveness testing

### Test Implementation Tasks

1. Set up pytest for backend testing
2. Create test fixtures and utilities
3. Implement component testing with React Testing Library
4. Set up Cypress for E2E testing
5. Implement CI pipeline for automated testing

## Bug Fixing Priority

1. Fix CORS issues in the backend
2. Improve error handling in AI quiz generation
3. Fix API endpoint issues in the frontend
4. Address any UI/UX issues identified during testing

## Deployment Strategy

- Containerize application with Docker
- Use Docker Compose for development
- Prepare production deployment with proper environment variables
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
